/**
 * Container used to execute actors.
 * <p>
 * The following usage example creates an instance of {@link ActorRunner}, adds an actor to it, and then shuts it down.
 * <pre>
 * // Create an ActorRunner. The address of all actors added will be prefixed with "local"
 * ActorRunner actorRunner = new ActorRunner("local");
 * 
 * // Add a new coroutine actor with the address "local:actor2". As soon as the actor is added, it will receive 2 incoming messages from
 * // itself: "start1" and "start2".
 * Coroutine myCoroutineActor = ...;
 * actorRunner.addActor("actor2", myCoroutineActor, "start1", "start2");
 * 
 * 
 * ... do some unrelated stuff here ...
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * // Shutdown the ActorRunner
 * actorRunner.close();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * All actors assigned to a runner can send messages to each other without any additional setup.
 * <p>
 * If you want outside components to be able to send messages to actors assigned to a runner, you'll need to pass those
 * outside components a reference to the {@link Shuttle} returned by {@link #getIncomingShuttle() }.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, if actors assigned to a runner are going to send messages to outside components, the {@link Shuttle}s for
 * those outgoing components need to be added using {@link #addOutgoingShuttle(com.offbynull.actors.core.shuttle.Shuttle) }.
 * <p>
 * If an actor tries to send a message to an address for which no outgoing shuttle has been added, that message is silently discarded.
